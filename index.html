									<p>“The temptation is great for government officials to manipulate economic statistics. Foremost among them is gross domestic product, the most commonly used measure of a country’s economy, which often serves as a proxy for a government’s financial stewardship. In a free society, groups like the civil service, media, businesses, and opposition leaders serve as a check on the impulse to flatter GDP figures. In autocratic regimes, there are fewer barriers.</p>
									<p>Turns out, there is an easy way to tell if a country’s GDP is being artificially inflated. How easy? Just look at the night sky.</p>
									<p>A large body of research shows that the brightness of a country’s night-time lights, as seen from satellites, is highly correlated with GDP growth. The more money people have, the more likely they are to have lights on at night. Businesses will also stay open later, resulting in even more light.</p>
									<p>If autocrats are goosing GDP, then the reported growth in those countries should be higher than night-time light data would suggest. This is exactly what the University of Chicago political scientist Luis Martinez found. In a recently released working paper, Martinez finds that in countries with similar growth in night-time brightness, the more autocratic regimes report higher GDP growth. His analysis examined the World Bank’s GDP growth data, Freedom House’s political freedom ratings, and satellite data from the US’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration from 1992 to 2008.”</p>

									<p>“By day Dan Houghton helps run Chilango, a Mexican restaurant chain in London, that he co-founded. By night, he is an algorithmic stock trader, coding complex, automated investment strategies once his children are in bed.</p>
									<p>In 2013 Mr Houghton sold an online texting company that he founded while studying mathematics at Cambridge university. The proceeds were ploughed into his restaurant and a new family home, but rather than deposit the remainder in a staid mutual fund he decided to use his maths skills to try to beat the market.</p>
									<p>After reading books on finance and scouring the internet for articles on “quantitative” investing, he stumbled over a company tailor-made for people like him: Quantopian, an online trading platform and “crowdsourced” hedge fund. The company is designed for a new breed of do-it-yourself algorithmic traders who develop automated investment strategies. Each month, the best “algos” win trading money from Quantopian and a select few are included in its embryonic hedge fund.”</p>
									<a class="lead" href="https://www.ft.com/content/5f9b2e40-0a8f-11e7-97d1-5e720a26771b">Machines and markets: 5 areas to watch.</a>
									<p>
										“1. ETFs are essentially investment algorithms of varying degrees of complexity, and typically automatically rebalance their holdings at the end of the day. As they have grown in importance — the amount invested in US ETFs reached a record high of $2.8tn at the end of February — so has the last half-hour of the trading day.
									</p>
									<p>
										2. ETFs are causing some oddities inside the US stock market. First-generation products that track the S&P 500 are fairly blunt tools for today’s investors, with many turning to sectoral ETFs or next-generation “smart beta” ETFs that surf certain equity characteristics, such as volatility or value. This can lead to some seemingly inexplicable movements. For example, a boring utility stock might suddenly become very exciting if “ low-volatility
									</p>
									<p>
										3. The 2010 “flash crash” in US equities is the most well-known example, but Christopher Giancarlo, the nominee to head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said this week that there had been at least 12 major flash crashes and “several dozen” minor ones since the introduction of the Dodd-Frank batch of regulations.
									</p>
									<p>
										4. While on a micro-market level this is caused by HFTs, it is also apparent in the evaporation of “earnings drift”, which is a broader phenomenon. Typically, when a company announces its earnings the stock would, after the first knee-jerk reaction, float higher and lower as fund managers explored the results in more depth over several days. But during the past decade this earnings drift has now pretty much disappeared, notes JPMorgan’s chief quant, Marko Kolanovic.
									</p>
									<p>
										5. Sell-offs appear more severe but are reversing more quickly than in the past, with markets recovering their footing after shocks such as Brexit, the US election and the Italian referendum within days or even hours. Mr Kolanovic estimates that these turning points are now coming at the fastest pace in three decades, driven by automated trading strategies that rapidly feed off news headlines. The rising popularity of momentum-surfing hedge funds is also contributing to “shorter and faster trends”, as strategies react quicker and lead to both over and undershooting from fundamentally-driven levels.”

										The ‘Best’ Trading Algorithms
									</h4>
									<p>
										This week, we’ll prime you for next week's Machine Learning Python Deep Dive with some simple machine learning models.
									</p>
									<p>
										It remains that the easier to implement and understand the model is the better the algorithm is to use but if we look at algos that are successful at competition level neither a single decision tree nor linear regression ends up making the top of the ranks.
									</p>
									<p>
										Successful models, from the research that I’ve done, fall into two main categories:
									</p>
									<li>
										Tree based frameworks
									</li>
									<li>
										Deep learning models
									</li>

									<h5 style="text-align: center;">
										Tree Based Framework
									</h5>
									<p class="lead">
										i. Concatenations of thousands of decision trees.
									</p>
									<p>
										What are decision trees?
									</p>
									<p>
										Decision trees are a set of rules used to classify data into categories. These types of algorithms tend to determine the most relevant data and the ‘tree’ is created by partitioning the data further. At each such point, we choose the question that allows for the bets split. Thus, we are ‘maximising information gain’. This process is recursive!
									</p>
									<p>
										A key advantage of a tree based framework against other models is that the results can be explained and justified; this is not always the case for neural networks for example. Often regulation dictates the model decisions must be explainable.
									</p>
									<p class="lead">
										ii. Gradient Boosted Trees.
									</p>
									<p>
										What are Gradient Boosted trees?
									</p>
									<p>
										This is a single tree that is recursively refined, until the weights given to each piece of data being fit to assist the algorithm in defining the fit. XGBoost is considered to be one of the best libraries to do this.
									</p>
									<p>
										What is XGBoost?
									</p>
									<p>
										It’s short for eXtreme gradient Boosting. This is a library designed and optimized for the boosted tree algorithm. Gradient Boosting is an approximation of Gradient Descent. Gradient Descent is a function that we aim to minimize.
									</p>
									<h5 style="text-align: center;">
										Deep Learning Based Framework
									</h5>
									<p>
										What is deep learning?
									</p>
									<p>
										Deep Learning uses neural networks to learn the relationships. It is an area within machine learning that uses multiple layers of increasingly rich functionality. Classes of Deep Neural Networks use feed-forward networks that work with convolution and pooling layers. Deep-Learning techniques were able to beat traditional machine learning problems such as image classification and speech recognition.

										Python Deep Dive
									</h4>
									<h5 style="text-align: center;">
										Intro and Getting Stock Price Data - Python Programming for Finance
									</h5>
									<p>
										This is the first of a series 28 videos introducing Algorithmic Trading. Some of the tutorials introduce you to Quantopian. It is crowd-sourced hedge fund that lets quants develop, test and use trading strategies available openly on the platform.
									</p>
									<p>
										Quantopian as a platform makes algorithmic trading accessible to anyone. But there are some basic functionalities that it lacks (in my opinion). They have stopped offering live trading sessions but it still provides a relatively simple framework to develop a quick idea. To fully develop and then backtest might be better to go elsewhere. (Quantiacs, potentially)
									</p>
									<p class="lead">
										There are 2 main ways to make money on Quantopian (Stocks only):
									</p>
									<p>
										1. Win their contest. The Quantopian Open awards cash prizes to the top algos, monthly.
									</p>
									<p>
										2. Be selected for capital allocation where Quantopian invests in your algo and you get a percentage of the trading profits.
									</p>
									<p>
										It’s pretty easy to see that this platform is not a bad place to start.
									</p>
									<p>
										This week’s Python Deep Dive introduces... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BrpKpWwT2A&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcOdF96TBtRtuQksErCEBYZ">Sentdex</a>, one the best programming focused youtubers I’ve ever found! His code and explanations are incredibly clear and are beginner friendly.

									<p>
										“On a ranch in northern Wyoming, not far from the Belle Fourche river, a few hundred calves are making history. They are being tagged and castrated and branded with irons, as is normal, a couple of months after birth. But what is new is that their IDs are now logged on a blockchain: part of a push by America’s least populated and most minerals-dependent state to position itself at the front of the “crypto” revolution.
									</p>
									<p>
										According to ranch owner, Ogden Driskill, blockchain technology can help to capture and preserve value along every step of the supply chain. He says that if he can prove to the ultimate buyer that these are open-range cattle, reared on sunshine and grass in cowboy country — rather than a cramped pen — he can get a premium of up to $700 per head, or almost 30 per cent.”

										Algo Concept: Statistical Arbitrage
									</h4>
									<p>
										Statistical Arbitrage is the buying and selling of many different securities with the aim of the portfolio manager, forecaster, to ‘neutralise’ risk-factors, based on statistically backed predictions.
									</p>
									<p>
										Fundamental to the concept is that, for example, the current price of a share is incorrect from the price that the forecaster believes it will return to.
									</p>
									<p>
										Forecasts are imperfect in the practical world and so there will be winning and losing trades. But the expectation is that the winning trade profits will exceed the losing trades.
									</p>
									<p>
										Statistical Arbitrage Algorithms are based on mean reversion theory, mostly as a pair. For example, if Apple’s price falls under $1 then Microsoft will fall by $0.5 but Microsoft has not fallen, so you will go and sell Microsoft to make a profit.
									</p>

									<h5 style="text-align: center;">
										Types of Statistical Arbitrage Trading Strategies
									</h5>
									<p class="lead">
										Directional trading
									</p>
									<p>
										In directional trading, each instrument’s signal is independent of another instrument in the portfolio. Here, the individual price series is stationary.
									</p>
									<p class="lead">
										Pairs, Triplets and other co-integrated portfolio trading
									</p>
									<p>
										In pairs trading, signal is triggered based on the difference in relative value between two or more instruments.
									</p>
									<p class="lead">
										Index arbitrage
									</p>
									<p>
										In Index arbitrage, signal is triggered based on the difference in relative value between an index’s constituents and an index future.

									<p>
										First, higher levels of comovement due to HFT cause more stock pairs to be cointegrated.

						Alongside this, we will be hosting weekly live trading sessions led by a PhD Computer Scientist. The first hour will consist of theory being taught and demonstrations of implementing the algorithms. The second hour will consist of live trading and group discussions regarding the market's behavior. We hope to build a community of Algo-traders which will support each other's endeavours into algorithmic trading.

					      <h6>Marketing and Events</h6>
					      <p>I am a second year biomedical engineer and in charge of marketing and events for the society. Previously, I participated in a spring insight week with BlackRock in the Trading and Liquidities Strategies Department. Over the past few months, I have become particularly interested in arbitrage modelling and analysis. Please feel free to contact me if you would like to talk more about these topics because I am also still learning! Also, do let me know if you would like to propose ideas for other events for the society, aside from the currently planned datathon and machine learning lecture series.</p>
