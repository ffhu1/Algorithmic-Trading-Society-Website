					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Hi Everyone,
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						We hope you all enjoyed the first newsletter and the first week of summer.	
					</p>	
					<p class="lead">
						Please find below the second newsletter written by Kaavya – a fantastic read.
					</p> 
					<p class="lead">
						Kind regards,

						Financial Markets
					</h4>
					<a class="lead" href="https://www.ft.com/content/b03e2f5e-fad6-11e7-a492-2c9be7f3120a">Meet the physicists selling time to traders</a>
					<p>“The UK National Physics Laboratory is the national measurement institute — it keeps the official time — and holds responsibility for making thousands of high-precision calibrations for science, physics and technology. Now, it has found a new commercial market: providing a reference point for the superfast computers that power global trading in the 21st century. More than a dozen institutions have signed up, including Intercontinental Exchange, one of the world’s largest exchanges operators, and UBS, the Swiss bank.”</p>
					<a class="lead" href="https://www.ft.com/content/67e48ae4-4fab-11e8-9471-a083af05aea7">Bond trading: technology finally disrupts a $50tn market</a>
					<p>“Abbie, an algorithm, might seem unremarkable to observers who have seen a series of technological revolutions reshape the stock market. But the bond market has historically been a vast but old-fashioned corner of the financial system, with little transparency and trading often conducted by phone.”</p>
					<a class="lead" href="https://www.ft.com/content/da69a410-6972-11e8-b6eb-4acfcfb08c11">Wyoming’s pioneering crypto cowboys beef up the supply chain</a>
					<p>
						“On a ranch in northern Wyoming, not far from the Belle Fourche river, a few hundred calves are making history. They are being tagged and castrated and branded with irons, as is normal, a couple of months after birth. But what is new is that their IDs are now logged on a blockchain: part of a push by America’s least populated and most minerals-dependent state to position itself at the front of the “crypto” revolution.
					</p>
					<p>
						According to ranch owner, Ogden Driskill, blockchain technology can help to capture and preserve value along every step of the supply chain. He says that if he can prove to the ultimate buyer that these are open-range cattle, reared on sunshine and grass in cowboy country — rather than a cramped pen — he can get a premium of up to $700 per head, or almost 30 per cent.”

						Algo Concept: Statistical Arbitrage
					</h4>
					<p>
						Statistical Arbitrage is the buying and selling of many different securities with the aim of the portfolio manager, forecaster, to ‘neutralise’ risk-factors, based on statistically backed predictions.
					</p>
					<p>
						Fundamental to the concept is that, for example, the current price of a share is incorrect from the price that the forecaster believes it will return to.
					</p>
					<p>
						Forecasts are imperfect in the practical world and so there will be winning and losing trades. But the expectation is that the winning trade profits will exceed the losing trades.
					</p>
					<p>
						Statistical Arbitrage Algorithms are based on mean reversion theory, mostly as a pair. For example, if Apple’s price falls under $1 then Microsoft will fall by $0.5 but Microsoft has not fallen, so you will go and sell Microsoft to make a profit.
					</p>

					<h5 style="text-align: center;">
						Types of Statistical Arbitrage Trading Strategies
					</h5>
					<p class="lead">
						Directional trading
					</p>
					<p>
						In directional trading, each instrument’s signal is independent of another instrument in the portfolio. Here, the individual price series is stationary.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Pairs, Triplets and other co-integrated portfolio trading
					</p>
					<p>
						In pairs trading, signal is triggered based on the difference in relative value between two or more instruments.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Index arbitrage
					</p>
					<p>
						In Index arbitrage, signal is triggered based on the difference in relative value between an index’s constituents and an index future.
					</p>

					<p>“Given the revolutionary shift in markets represented by high frequency trading (HFT), it is unsurprising that risks and rewards have changed. This paper explores the effect of HFT volume on statistical arbitrage profitability, and reports three trends in the data.</p>
					<p>
						First, higher levels of comovement due to HFT cause more stock pairs to be cointegrated.
						<br>
						Second, profitability from statistical arbitrage remains steady among the deciles with the most HFT.
						<br>
						Third, the range of profitability is larger in more recent years.”

						Hey Everyone!
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						Congrats on making it through the year and we hope everyone’s enjoying the start of summer.		
					</p>	
					<p class="lead">
						Following our launch event with BlackRock, it is now the perfect time to start building a community of people who are keen to discuss and develop their own Algorithmic Trading ideas. This can be in preparation for upcoming Datathons in the next academic term or simply for fun. Through the Summer and into next term we will be posting weekly newsletters, containing three main concepts: Market-Related News, an Algorithmic Trading Concept, and a Python Deep Dive. The content will become more advanced as we go through the Summer.
					</p>
					<p class="lead">
						We encourage everyone to get involved with the society through our Slack channel! Sharing of opinions and further knowledge on articles mentioned or posting of possible resources to be featured in future newsletters are very welcome.

					<p>It aims to increase liquidity (how easily something can be sold in the market) and makes market spreads (the difference between the bid and ask prices) tighter. An article to give you a scale of the HFT industry.</p>
					<a class="lead" href="https://www.quantinsti.com/blog/most-popular-high-frequency-strategies-revealed/">Popular High-Frequency Trading Strategies.</a>
					<p>“It’s also worth noting that those within the industry understand that strategy alone doesn’t contribute to its success. Often, simple strategies that pretty much everyone knows are implemented by Quant Trading firms like Jump Trading or Jane Street but what separates them is the speed of their technologies. HFT is like a 100m sprint. If there’s no foul the fastest will win!”</p>
					<p class="lead">Book Recommendation “Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt” Michael Lewis</p>
					<p>“Informative and contains anecdotes about High-Frequency trading. However, as a warning, it’s opinionated! The author tends to criminalise the industry as a whole. But, we know that HFT allows for liquidity at a smaller price than other, more understood and traditional market makers. With a little extra research, it can help form a balanced opinion on the industry.”</p>

						ABOUT US
					</h2>
				</div>
				<p class="lead">
					As of March 2018, we became a society for the first time at Imperial College London and have since held a launch event where participants were introduced to the society and the activities we will be planning for the upcoming academic year.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					Regardless of whether you are a novice to trading or a veteran Quant, all are welcomed to be part of the society. If you want to learn more about simple trading strategies or more complicated statistical arbitrage of stocks, the society hopes to bring students closer to learning and developing their understanding and application of algorithms in a financially driven context.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					Current plans for society activities include a machine learning lecture series in Python to be held during the upcoming academic year.
				</p>

				<p class="lead">
					Alongside this, we will be hosting weekly live trading sessions led by a PhD Computer Scientist. The first hour will consist of theory being taught and demonstrations of implementing the algorithms. The second hour will consist of live trading and group discussions regarding the market's behavior. We hope to build a community of Algo-traders which will support each other's endeavours into algorithmic trading.
